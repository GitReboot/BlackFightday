                <p class="text">The objective of the game is to have the most score at the end of the round. You can increase score by picking up items that spawn around the map and disposing these into your shopping cart.</p>
                <p class="text">Each item has a different value and weight. The higher the value, the more score is added to your total. Heavier items will slow down player movement and will travel less distance in the air when thrown.</p>
                <p class="text">You can steal items from players by attacking them. A player will drop its item at the end of a combo or on death. It is advised not to use any movement inputs while attacking, so you will not walk through your opponent during combat.</p>
                <p class="text">Dropping an item during combat or throwing an item on the ground will damage it. An item will have less value if it is dropped too often. Eventually, it will break and despawn.</p>
                <p class="text">Aside from regular items, there are also 3 powerup items. These items are special and can either be thrown or consumed. Beware that by throwing a powerup item, the item will break immediately after. See below for more info on all available powerups:</p>
